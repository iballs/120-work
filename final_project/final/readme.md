The last lesson in this class felt like the key that unlocked the door to creating complex sketches. By being able to add external files, insert objects from other sketches and create my own functions I feel like I have the tools to create anything I can imagine given the right amount of time. With that being said, I wish that I had more time to complete this assignment.

The hardest part of this class for me was figuring out the logic to make my code work and this became especially difficult for me the further I got into this particular sketch. When you open my sketch you will see that I have a lot of variables, this is because I could not make the same variables work multiple times. For example, if I had one side of a shape that continued to grow I struggled to make it reverse and shrink. I tried changing it to a negative number when it reached a parameter or had it multiplied by a negative, but I simply couldn’t figure out how to make multiple shapes ‘shrink.’ The work around for this of course was to just keep on making new variables.

 This was the first time I had to create so many variables and write out my code in such a long form. While this didn’t seem problematic at first it quickly became apparent that a web browser could only able to handle so many lines. I think a lot of the issues stem from the campus wifi from being fairly slow, but in its current state, my code seems to run fairly slow when it is viewed online. It’s often buggy and seems to only work the first time around. If it has to be restarted it usually crashes or lags. While I don’t think there are any problems in my logic and with my code, cleaning it up would probably help it run smoother. Right now though, I was just concerned with whether or not it would work. Unfortunately, my code doesn’t seem to work on several browsers, it does however run fairly smooth on safari so make sure that is how you view it to get the best results.

The one thing I felt for certain should’ve worked, but didn’t was creating for loops with changing variables. For example, you’ll see that my lines are taken from an array instead of a for loop. This is because when I entered a variable into multiple objects it simply wouldn’t work. So if I drew 10 lines based off of one for loop and wanted them to ‘grow’ by changing their y value it wouldn’t work. This works when the lines are separate code, but when the ‘growing’ variable is introduced to a for loop it stops working correctly and now longer ‘grows.’ Why is this? I know there has to be a simpler way than using an array, but I couldn’t find a solution that worked.

One success I had with my code was being able to sync it up with the music. I wasn’t aware of the p5 sound functions until I watched the Shiftman tutorials on measuring sound frequencies and amplitude. I managed to play and tweak with his code enough to make it my own and understand how to shape it. Live soundscape will certainly be something I will be experimenting with this summer.

Overall, I was very happy that I took this class. I thought that learning the basics of code might be fun and useful, but I didn’t think that it would challenge me as much as it did. I’ve never been a math or science type person, but figuring out the logic of code and thinking about how I can turn numbers and letters into a live sketch is something I absolutely love doing and will probably continue to practice outside of this class. I hope the code works for you in your browser and thank you for the amazing semester. This was by far the best structured online class I have ever taken!
