## Hw-8 Review

Boy did I struggle to get ‘for’ to work. I could understand why while worked, thanks to the Shiftman example in which he compared it to the ‘if’ variable. In order to get something to work I first, typed the complete code out, then replaced the values with variable and turned it to a ‘while’ statement, but when ever I went from a ‘while’ to a ‘for’ statement I broke the code. I couldn’t tell if I needed to add a new local variable or if I could work with ones I had declared globally.

I think part of my problem stemmed from trying to embed my ‘for’ statements inside of a ‘mouseIsPressed’ statement. Is doing this breaking the code? I understand listing out what I want the loop to do in three separate statements like Shiftman explained, but I don’t get how to combine those three elements into a  ‘for’ statement. I’m defining the variable, setting it’s conditions, and then modifying it in every loop, but the code still keeps breaking. I’ll be coming in next week to learn how to fix this and figure out how to turn my while statements into for statements.

The code I created however was a work around to what I was trying to create with ‘for’ statements. I wanted to create a spaceship that would appear as if it were flying through space and would be able to fire lasers when the mouse was pressed. I wanted my for statement to control the stars moving down the screen, but instead I just made one randomly placed square on the x axis that would move towards the bottom where it would reset.
