# Final Project Proposal

For my final project I would like to create a visual soundscape or a ‘music video.’  Earlier in the semester I went to go see the artist Kelly Lee Owens play a show in Idaho and I thought that the visual soundscapes she projected behind her as she played were really cool. They also seemed fairly basic so I want to see if I could give it a try. You can check out an example of her stuff here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjyxg1zVjDs). There was also a student example used in the class shell so I know it’s possible for someone taking creative code to figure out how to create a visual soundscape.

Obviously I will have to learn how to incorporate sound into my sketches. This means that I will either have to:

Figure out how to make my code respond to the music or…
Make sure my code syncs up to whatever song I am playing and....
Figure out how to put mp3 or wav files into my sketches.

Because of this I will try to find a short song, that is fairly basic so that I can make the music video seem fluid. If I can make it work, I might try to do a music video for one of Kelly Lee Owens’ songs.
I consider myself fairly good with time management so I thought I might just split my work plan into chunks of 3 or 4 days.

1.  I wanted to see if it would be possible to find some sort of code that could “respond” to music. This might be fairly complicated though so I may have to switch to plan B.
2. I will upload an mp3 file to my code and begin to time out the transformations that will need to occur to the background when the music changes. For example, find out whenever the beat drops and convert that into frames that will sync up with the changes.
3. One I have my stuff mapped and timed I will start filling the sketch with interesting or ‘trippy’ visuals.

I’ve already started to look into code that might help my sounds sync up with my visuals. It seems a little complicated to me so I may just start to code my video and make sure the tempo changes sync up with whatever I am coding. I’ve uploaded the song and now I am beginning to figure out when changes to the visuals will need to occur.
