## Hw-10 Review

I had an epiphany during this week’s lesson that I wish I would’ve thought about earlier in the semester. Why should I struggle to create an object or a function that someone else has already made? Learning how to create my own functions certainly helped me realize this. For example, I’ve been wondering how to create other shapes without having to go through the tedious task of writing out the code for something like a star. Once I realized that shapes were functions, I realized all I had to do was google the code and I could use the function in my own sketches. I did exactly this with the stars in this week’s homework.

For my homework I built upon our last homework where I created a kind of spaceship game. I knew I wanted to change my pixelated stars into an actual star shape, so I copied the star code and defined a new function. Once I had the star function I was able to replace it with the rect function I had previously been using.

Next I implemented and array by placing text in the center of the canvas that would change every time the mouse was clicked. For some reason I had to declare all of this globally. Every time I tried to place my index-changes elsewhere it wouldn’t work. Was this because I already had a mouseIsPressed event in my code?

I’m looking forward to the weeks to come now that I know how to create functions. I feel like this opened the floodgates for me to be able to think something up, google the code, place it in my sketches and play with it in whatever way I want to.
