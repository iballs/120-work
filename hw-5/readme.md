There was a lot to learn this week and I feel like I followed most of it, but I still have a few questions about animation. I'll get to my issues in a second, but first I want to walk through my creation and talk about what I intended for it to do.

I wanted black lines to come down from the top of the screen, while white lines passed from left to right. Then I wanted the circle in the middle to change it's width and height as you moved your mouse around the screen. The final thing I wanted was the circle to change color when you clicked the screen. This being said I ran into some issues and have more questions then when I began...

I realized that the circle would continously redraw itself so everytime it changed shape it would leave a lasting imprint on the screen. This looked kind of cool when you changed the color, but it was not what I intended.

- How can I make a shape change it's shape and size without it redrawing itself? If I put it in setup could the shape and size?

The other big question I had wasn't necessarily an issue, but answering it could help my creations have a much more interesting scope.

- How can I reverse animations? In my creation the lines run across the screen and create a grid, but I want for them to be able to back up and move forward again on their own.

I'm sure if I had more time to play around with animations this week I could figure out how to time things and make them act the way I want them to. For now though, I think I have a basic grasp on how to make things move and interact around the screen.
