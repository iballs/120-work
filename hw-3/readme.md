## HW-3 Response
After creating my "Hello World" program I can tell that I am going to enjoy coding. The fact that the code did not work a few times and I was forced to play around until something worked was extreemly satisfying.

After copying the empty example and watching the videos I wanted to try and write the program without any help. I knew that my first attempt at opening the code on my browser was not going to work, but I knew that with such a short bit of code I could figure it out by myself with a little trial and error.

The biggest issue I ran into stemmed from me not fulling understaing what function did. I initially thought it was a signal for the whole program to run, not just the setup that followed it. I initially tried embedding my canvas, backgroud, color, text, etc. all in the the first function. After playing around with the parenthesis for a little bit I realized that function only related to the command given directly after it. I would need a seperate function for draw, then for setup.

I really enjoyed playing around with the formatting of the page after reading the descriptions of what certain functions did. I quickly realized that based on how many inputs a funciton could handle that I could fill it with material I already knew. For example in color, you could input a name, a greyscale number, or a cmyk color code to get a specific color.

I did not use much use of the course repo this time around, but next week I am making sure that I allow myself ample time to finish my assignment so I can utilize it for any upcoming issues I may have or to help other who may be struggling. I really appreciate you reminding us to use it in our response questions.

I can't wait for next week's class. I hope it is more challenging / explorative so I can learn more through struggling with the code.
