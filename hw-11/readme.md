## Hwk-11 Review

This was probably the most frustrating lesson I’ve gone though in this class. No matter how many times I tried to create my own class and objects I couldn’t seem to get them to work. I ended up altering the example code piece by piece so I could get some functional code. What irritated me the most though was when I edited the example so that it looked like the code I was trying to write from scratch and it worked. The two pieces of code were identical! I wish I would’ve taken a screenshot of my code before erasing it, but I couldn’t seem to find any errors in it. Oh well, I guess the whole reason github exists in the first place is so that you can alter already functional pieces of code.

I think I have a loose grip on how to create objects and piece together different blocks of code now. The one thing that I couldn’t wrap my head around though was how to create high numbers of objects from a single class that had a lot of variations. For example I know how to make a hundred random objects from a class, and I know how to make a hundred identical objects from the piece of code, but how can I make one hundred unique objects from the same class. How could I make a high number of objects that were different sizes, shapes, colors, etc, that are still tied to a controlled variable. Do I have to type all of these out and tie them to the parameters / arguments of a class?

I still feel a bit rusty on classes and objects, but now that I understand what they are it should be easier for me to find and adapt other objects that I can find online. I realize that finding and piecing together objects that I find online can help me create more complex sketches then I would be able to create by writing my code from scratch. I’m excited to see where we will go next week!
